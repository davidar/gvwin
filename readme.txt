Globalview 2.1
Released in 1996 by Xerox
For Windows 3.1, 95, 98. (Not NT!)

The final, Windows 3.1 port of Xerox Globalview. Globalview is the descendant
of the Xerox Star.
This application uses .386 VxD files, it will only work under Windows
3.1, 95, 98, and possibly ME. It does not work under Windows NT 4, 2000,
XP or Vista. 

To install, you need to use the following software keys: 0fc035594,
1fc034883, 7kw035372. These don't unlock all of the functionality but
the rest is just a couple of small things that you don't really need. 

If you do want to force it to install those other components, start the
globalview setup, but before you proceed with the actual installation 
copy the included packdesc.txt over the packdesc.txt that the setup
extracted with this one. (The edited one makes it include the groups 
that require the missing keys as part of the first group for which 
there is a key.)
